# CWS-AJAX

## Explanation  
This was an attempt to understand the workings of async and await in conjunction with AJAX. Although the code is relatively static, it does function as intended.   This is version 1.0 and I plan to revisit and improve it in the future. This exercise served as a valuable practice for an upcoming, larger project. By breaking down and focusing on smaller elements, I have gained a deeper understanding of how to approach and improve upon this concept.
